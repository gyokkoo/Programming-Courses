Extraterrestrial oceans may be composed of water 
or other elements and compounds. The only confirmed 
large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface 
liquids are the lakes of Titan, although there 
is evidence for the existence of oceans elsewhere 
in the Solar System. Early in their geologic 
histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to 
have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean 
hypothesis suggests that nearly a third of the 
surface of Mars was once covered by water, 
and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled 
away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as 
salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its 
freezing point, so that water might exist in large 
quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine 
or convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated 
beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural 
satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is estimated 
to have over twice the water volume of Earth. 
The Solar System's giant planets are also 
thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of 
yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may 
also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including 
surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar 
habitable zone. Ocean planets are a hypothetical 
type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.
